In 2017, there were 17,799 accidents on Swiss roads causing body injuries. Even though the number of victims is decreasing since 25 years, Switzerland still faces around 20,000 victims each year, that's to say 0,25% of the population. In this data story, we are interested in understanding the most important factors on the number of car accidents. First, a quick investigation is proposed showing a few classifications of drivers dangerousness, victims vulnerability, periods with more accidents as well as substances consumed before accidents. This contextualisation at national scale is then followed by a machine-learning-based approach to determine which factors have the higher influence on car accidents in each canton. Finally, some visual plots of correlation are shown between these factors and accidents in Switzerland.
Have a nice trip in our data story!
